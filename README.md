# Emojis Everywhere
Do you like emojis? :thumbsup:

This tool allows you to invoke an emoji picker from any app, by pressing a keyboard shortcut.

I made this app by throwing some nice libraries together then watching the magic happen:

* [emojione-picker](https://github.com/tommoor/emojione-picker) by Tom Moor
* [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) by GitHub
* [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) by electron's community
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) by Facebook
